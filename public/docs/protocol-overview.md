# Evermark Protocol

## What is Evermark?

Evermark Protocol is a decentralized system for creating permanent, verifiable references to online content. Built on the Base blockchain, it allows users to mark any digital content and ensure it remains accessible and attributable forever.

## Key Features

### Permanent References
- Create immutable links to any online content
- Store metadata on IPFS for decentralized access
- Blockchain-verified ownership and timestamps

### Social Discovery
- Discover content through community curation
- Build personal collections of valuable references
- Share and explore evermarked content in Farcaster or via PWA or webapp

### Farcaster Integration
- Native support for Farcaster casts 
- Seamless wallet integration in Farcaster frames
- Social sharing and discovery features

## How It Works

1. **Create**: Submit a URL or Farcaster cast to create an Evermark
2. **Store**: Metadata is stored on IPFS, reference recorded on-chain
3. **Share**: Your Evermark becomes part of the permanent web
4. **Discover**: Browse and collect Evermarks from the community

## Smart Contracts

The protocol consists of several interconnected smart contracts:

- **Evermark NFT**: Core NFT contract for minting and managing Evermarks
