# Reward System

Evermark Protocol rewards active community members with dual-token distributions based on their participation in governance and platform usage.

## Dual-Token Rewards

### ETH Rewards
**Source**: Platform revenue from user activity
- Minting fees paid when creating Evermark NFTs
- Generated in real ETH from actual platform usage
- Distributed proportionally to active wEMARK stakers

### EMARK Rewards
**Source**: Token emission schedule
- Distributed to incentivize platform participation
- Earned through governance activities
- Can be reinvested by wrapping to wEMARK

## Earning Rewards

### Eligibility
- **Hold wEMARK**: Must have wrapped EMARK tokens
- **Active Participation**: Engage in weekly voting cycles
- **Delegation**: Higher delegation rates increase rewards

### Distribution Schedule
- **Frequency**: Regular distribution periods
- **Calculation**: Based on your wEMARK stake and participation
- **Claiming**: Rewards can be claimed when available

## Participation Multipliers

Active governance participation increases your share of rewards:

### Delegation Bonuses
Your reward multiplier depends on how much of your wEMARK you delegate:

| Delegation Rate | Multiplier | Bonus |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| 0-49%          | 1.0x       | None  |
| 50-74%         | 1.25x      | +25%  |
| 75-99%         | 1.5x       | +50%  |
| 100%           | 2.0x       | +100% |

### How It Works
1. **Track Delegation**: System monitors your wEMARK delegation percentage
2. **Apply Multiplier**: Higher participation rates get bonus rewards
3. **Compound Effect**: Increased rewards can be reinvested for more voting power
