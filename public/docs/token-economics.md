# Token Economics

Evermark Protocol operates with a dual-token system designed to separate utility from governance.

## Token Overview

### $EMARK Token
- **Purpose**: Utility token for platform operations
- **Use Cases**: Minting fees for creating Evermark NFTs
- **Supply**: Fixed supply with controlled emission
- **Transferability**: Fully liquid and tradeable

### wEMARK Token  
- **Purpose**: Governance token with voting power
- **Mechanism**: Wrapped version of staked EMARK tokens
- **Voting Power**: 1 wEMARK = 1 vote in governance cycles
- **Unbonding**: 7-day period required to unstake back to EMARK

## Wrapping Process

Users can wrap their EMARK tokens to participate in governance:

1. **Wrap EMARK**: Convert liquid EMARK to wEMARK for voting
2. **Gain Voting Power**: Use wEMARK to delegate votes to Evermarks
3. **Earn Rewards**: Receive dual-token rewards for participation
4. **Unwrap**: Request unstaking with 7-day unbonding period

## Reward System

Active participants earn rewards in two tokens:

### ETH Rewards
- Generated from platform fees (minting costs)
- Distributed to active wEMARK stakers
- Real economic value from platform usage

### EMARK Rewards
- Distributed via emission schedule
- Incentivizes long-term participation
- Can be reinvested by wrapping to wEMARK

## Participation Multipliers

The protocol rewards consistent participation with bonus multipliers:

- **50%+ Delegation**: 1.25x reward multiplier
- **75%+ Delegation**: 1.5x reward multiplier  
- **100% Delegation**: 2.0x reward multiplier

*Delegation percentage = (Delegated wEMARK / Total wEMARK) Ã— 100*
