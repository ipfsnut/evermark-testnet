# Governance & Voting

Evermark Protocol features a democratic voting system where community members use wEMARK tokens to curate content through weekly voting cycles.

## Weekly Voting Cycles

### How It Works
- **Duration**: 7-day voting periods
- **Participation**: Open to all wEMARK token holders
- **Scope**: Vote on any existing Evermark NFT
- **Restriction**: Cannot vote on your own created Evermarks

### Voting Process
1. **Hold wEMARK**: Wrap EMARK tokens to get voting power
2. **Delegate Votes**: Assign your wEMARK to support specific Evermarks
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor real-time voting tallies
4. **Cycle Completion**: Rankings update at end of each week

## Vote Delegation

### Mechanics
- **Vote Weight**: 1 wEMARK = 1 vote
- **Flexible Delegation**: Change votes anytime during the cycle
- **Multiple Targets**: Split votes across different Evermarks
- **Available Balance**: Only undelegated wEMARK can be used

### Strategy
- **Quality Focus**: Support Evermarks you believe deserve recognition
- **Diversification**: Spread votes across multiple quality pieces
- **Timing**: Early votes help establish momentum
- **Consistency**: Regular participation increases rewards

## Leaderboard System

### Weekly Rankings
- **Top Evermarks**: Ranked by total wEMARK votes received
- **Live Updates**: Real-time vote tracking during cycles
- **Historical Data**: Previous week results available
- **Community Recognition**: Top-voted content gets featured placement

### Benefits for Creators
- **Visibility**: Higher-ranked Evermarks get more exposure
- **Community Validation**: Democratic recognition of quality
- **Network Effects**: Popular content attracts more attention

## Reward Bonuses

Consistent voting participation increases your reward multipliers:

### Delegation Thresholds
- **Base Rate**: No delegation bonus
- **50-74% Delegated**: +25% reward multiplier
- **75-99% Delegated**: +50% reward multiplier
- **100% Delegated**: +100% reward multiplier

### Calculation
Your delegation percentage is calculated as:
```
(Your Delegated wEMARK รท Your Total wEMARK) ร 100
```

Higher delegation rates demonstrate active community participation and are rewarded accordingly.
