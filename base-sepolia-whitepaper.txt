Evermark Protocol: Smart Contract Architecture
Abstract
The Evermark Protocol implements a comprehensive decentralized ecosystem for content curation, preservation, and monetization through a sophisticated multi-contract architecture. This system combines NFT-based content preservation, token staking mechanisms, delegation-based governance, and automated reward distribution to create a self-sustaining platform that incentivizes quality content creation and community participation.

1. System Overview
1.1 Core Philosophy
The Evermark Protocol operates on the principle that valuable content should be preserved, discoverable, and rewarded through community consensus. The system implements a dual-token economy where content preservation (NFTs) and governance participation (EMARK tokens) work synergistically to create sustainable value flows.

1.2 Architecture Principles
Modularity: Each contract serves a specific purpose while maintaining interoperability
Upgradeability: All contracts use OpenZeppelin's upgradeable proxy pattern
Security: Multi-layered access controls and emergency circuit breakers
Efficiency: Gas-optimized operations with batch processing capabilities
Sustainability: Self-funding reward mechanisms through fee collection

Metadata Storage: On-chain title, creator, and IPFS URI storage
Batch Minting: Gas-efficient bulk operations (max 10 per transaction)
Failed Payment Recovery: Safe referral payment system with manual claim fallback
Technical Implementation:
struct EvermarkMetadata {
    string title;           // Content title (max 200 chars)
    string creator;         // Creator attribution
    string metadataURI;     // IPFS metadata URI (max 500 chars)
    uint256 creationTime;   // Block timestamp
    address minter;         // NFT creator address
    address referrer;       // Referral address
}



Economic Model:

Referral Reward: 10% of minting fee to referrer
Protocol Fee: 90% to fee collection system
3.2 CardCatalog: Token Staking Infrastructure
Purpose: Enables EMARK token holders to stake tokens in exchange for voting power and rewards eligibility.

Staking Mechanics:
1:1 Ratio: 1 EMARK staked = 1 voting power unit
Unbonding Period: 7-day withdrawal delay for security
Delegation Tracking: Monitors voting power allocation
Transfer Restrictions: Staked tokens are non-transferable
Unbonding System:
struct UnbondingRequest {
    uint256 amount;         // Tokens to unbond
    uint256 releaseTime;    // When tokens become claimable
    bool active;            // Request status flag
}



Security Features:
Emergency Circuit Breaker: Admin-controlled pause mechanism
Batch Operations: Limited to 50 operations per transaction
Index Manipulation Protection: Active flags prevent array manipulation attacks
3.3 EvermarkVoting: Governance Engine
Purpose: Implements weekly voting cycles where staked token holders delegate voting power to content they value.

Voting Cycles:
Duration: 7-day cycles with automatic progression
Delegation Model: Users delegate voting power to specific NFTs
Anti-Gaming: Users cannot vote on their own content
Batch Operations: Support for multiple delegations (max 20 per transaction)
Leaderboard Computation:
struct LeaderboardEntry {
    uint256 bookmarkId;     // NFT token ID
    uint256 votes;          // Total votes received
}



Efficiency Optimizations:

Insertion Sort: Efficient sorting for small datasets (≤100 entries)
Pagination Support: Chunked data access for large result sets
3.4 EvermarkRewards: Economic Coordination Hub
Purpose: Orchestrates the weekly reward distribution across all ecosystem participants.

Reward Distribution Model:
Weekly Reward Pool (100%)
├── 60% → Token Stakers
│   ├── 30% → Base Rewards (proportional to stake)
│   └── 30% → Variable Rewards (proportional to delegation)
└── 40% → Content Creators (leaderboard-based)



Weekly Cycle Management:
struct WeeklyRewardCycle {
    uint256 week;                    // Cycle number
    uint256 startTime;               // Cycle start timestamp
    uint256 endTime;                 // Cycle end timestamp
    uint256 totalRewardPool;         // Total EMARK allocated
    uint256 tokenStakerPool;         // 60% allocation
    uint256 creatorPool;             // 40% allocation
    bool finalized;                  // Calculation complete
    bool distributed;                // Rewards distributed
}



Reward Calculation:
Base Rewards: (userStake / totalStaked) × basePool
Variable Rewards: (userDelegated / userStake) × maxVariableReward
Creator Rewards: Leaderboard-based distribution with tier weighting

Ranks 51+: Participation rewards (10% of creator pool)
Technical Features:
Batch Processing: Handles up to 50 creators per transaction
Error Resilience: Try-catch blocks prevent single failures from blocking distribution
Gas Optimization: Efficient sorting algorithms for leaderboard computation
4.2 NFTStaking: Utility Staking System
Purpose: Provides additional utility for Evermark NFTs through staking with lock periods and vote-based rewards.

Lock Period Options:
7 Days: 1.5× reward multiplier
14 Days: 2.0× reward multiplier
30 Days: 3.0× reward multiplier
Reward Calculation:
baseReward = votesReceived × 0.001 EMARK
finalReward = baseReward × lockPeriodMultiplier

Conclusion
The Evermark Protocol represents a sophisticated approach to decentralized content curation that aligns economic incentives with community value creation. Through its multi-contract architecture, the system creates sustainable value flows that reward both content creators and community curators while maintaining security, efficiency, and upgradeability.

The protocol's design emphasizes long-term sustainability through self-funding mechanisms, progressive decentralization, and robust security measures. By combining NFT-based content preservation with token-based governance, Evermark creates a comprehensive ecosystem for the preservation and monetization of valuable digital content.

This architecture serves as a foundation for a new class of decentralized applications that prioritize community-driven value creation while maintaining the technical rigor necessary for production deployment at scale.
